                Vincent Willem van Gogh (March 30, 1853 - July 29, 1890)
                Being one of the most enigmatic and prolific painters of the late
                19th century, Van Gogh's influence on modern art is indisputable.
                Despite his constant fight against mental illness, he produced more
                than 2,100 works of art, a large number of which were self-portraits.
                His history as an artist is long established. However, his personal
                life story is best known for the large number of letters he wrote.
                Especially his brother Theo.

                </figure>
                
                <p>The painting depicts the terrace of the Place du Forum
                    with several people seated on tables seen in the background.
                    The painting’s foreground depicts empty tables and chairs and
                    the entrance to the coffee house. The green windows on the
                    café’s first floor are open. The atmosphere in the painting
                    is a nocturnal setting with the sky being star-lit and the
                    tables are lit by overhanging lanterns. On the right side of
                    the painting, several buildings as well as branches of a tree
                    are depicted.

                </figure>
                <p>Vincent van Gogh painted Irises shortly after he voluntarily
                    admitted himself into the St.-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy,
                    France. Irises was painted in the garden to the south of the men's
                    quarters--the only area Van Gogh was permitted to work during the
                    first month of his confinement. The scene is a symphony of vibrant
                    colours with the magnificent violet iris petals dominating the rich
                    red soil and the bright orange marigolds in the background.

                <p>
                    Blossoming Almond Tree is one of Vincent van Gogh's best known paintings
                    and is noteworthy in that both Van Gogh and his closest family held the
                    work in high regard. This painting is one of a small handful that Van Gogh
                    produced with a particular person in mind--in this case, his brother and
                    sister-in-law's newborn baby. Van Gogh was deeply moved when Theo and Johanna
                    chose to name the child Vincent and he always harboured a great deal of
                    affection for the child. Van Gogh painted Blossoming Almond Tree to honour
                    his namesake and it remains a tour-de-force, both the product of Vincent's
                    fondness for his nephew as well as the Japanese art which he so greatly admired.

                <p>
                    In August, 1888 Vincent van Gogh began painting a series of works which, as
                    Dr. Jan Hulsker suggests "perhaps more than any other of his paintings,
                    have made him known throughout the world. They are often the only works
                    with which he is identified." This series is, of course, the sunflowers.
                    <br>
                    Van Gogh envisioned his sunflower works as a series and worked diligently
                    on them in anticipation of the arrival in Arles of his friend, Paul Gauguin.
                    In a letter to Emile Bernard written around 21 August 1888 Vincent wrote:
                    "I’m thinking of decorating my studio with half a dozen paintings of Sunflowers.
                    A decoration in which harsh or broken yellows will burst against various blue
                    backgrounds, from the palest Veronese to royal blue, framed with thin laths
                    painted in orange lead. Sorts of effects of stained-glass windows of a
                    Gothic church."

            <h2>Starry Night</h2>

                <p>
                    Starry Night is probably Vincent van Gogh's most famous painting.
                    This was painted while Vincent was in the asylum at Saint-Rémy and
                    his behaviour was very erratic at the time, due to the severity of his
                    attacks. Unlike most of Van Gogh's works, Starry Night was painted from
                    memory and not outdoors as was Vincent's preference. This may, in part,
                    explain why the emotional impact of the work is so much more powerful
                    than many of Van Gogh's other works from the same period.
