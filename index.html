                Vincent Willem van Gogh (March 30, 1853 - July 29, 1890)
                Being one of the most enigmatic and prolific painters of the late 
                19th century, Van Gogh's influence on modern art is indisputable. 
                Despite his constant fight against mental illness, he produced more 
                than 2,100 works of art, a large number of which were self-portraits. 
                His history as an artist is long established. However, his personal 
                life story is best known for the large number of letters he wrote. 
                Especially his brother Theo.
